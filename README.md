🌾 Crop Yield Prediction in Indian States
📌 Project Overview

This project aims to analyze and predict crop yield patterns across different states of India using a machine learning approach. By leveraging real-world data, we intend to build a predictive model that helps understand how crop yields vary based on state, year, and crop type.

This repository currently contains the Week 1 Milestone Submission of a 7-week internship project. At this stage, we have:

Collected and explored the dataset.

Performed initial preprocessing.

Trained a basic regression model.

Achieved a preliminary accuracy score of 78.21%.

The project will be further developed in the coming weeks with deeper analysis, advanced models, and improved accuracy.

📊 Dataset

Source: Crop Yield in Indian States Dataset

Format: CSV

Details: Contains data about different crops, their production, area harvested, and yield across multiple Indian states over time.

🔑 Current Progress (Week 1)

✔️ Loaded the dataset into Pandas DataFrame.
✔️ Displayed initial records (.head()).
✔️ Performed basic EDA (checking null values, datatypes, unique values).
✔️ Trained a simple regression model.
✔️ Achieved initial prediction accuracy of 78.21%.

🚀 Next Steps (Planned for upcoming weeks)

🔹 Data cleaning & handling missing values.
🔹 Feature engineering to improve dataset quality.
🔹 Testing multiple ML algorithms (RandomForest, XGBoost, etc.).
🔹 Hyperparameter tuning for better performance.
🔹 Visualization dashboards for insights.
🔹 Final deployment of the model as a web app.
